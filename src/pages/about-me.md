Through curiosity, courage, and a deep commitment to growth, Iâ€™ve moved through trauma, health challenges, and difficult diagnoses. I believed it was possible - and made it happen.

Iâ€™ve been obsessed with personal growth since I was a teenager, and now I guide others to experience the transformation that self-awareness makes possible.
