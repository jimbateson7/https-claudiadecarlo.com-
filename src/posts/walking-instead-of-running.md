The past 18 months have been filled with endings, upheaval, and deep identity shifts - many happening all at once.

Some transitions arrive gently. Others crack your life open.

I read today:

> “… And you were supposed to sit in your pain for a while.
>
> This isn't because you deserve it; it's not a form of punishment.
>
> The only way that you could shake off that old version of you, the version that actually thought the bare minimum could ever be considered effort.
>
> You needed this pain to wake you up, because otherwise you would never grow and become the person you're supposed to be. Remember, growth often starts with discomfort.”

I’m still here, committed to my path more than ever. But right now, I’m walking instead of running.

I need grounding before I continue building

A strong house needs a solid foundation.

I haven’t abandoned this newsletter - I’ve just been listening to my nervous system ask for tenderness, not pressure.

I’ll be back, slowly.

I realised that if I’m working on my self-esteem - and I encourage others to do the same - then honouring this stage is invaluable, even if the progress feels slow.

With love,

P.S. If the London Marathon 2026 is calling you, [Whizz Kidz](https://www.whizz-kidz.org.uk/) has places - and they’re amazing. Highly recommend them.
