I created this Substack 4 weeks ago with one clear intention:\
To share my story in a way that sparks transformation.\
To reach many, while still creating space for deep connection.\
To inspire you to let go of what no longer serves, so you can move toward what truly matters.

Time flies when you’re having fun, yes - but also when you’re navigating challenges.

And we all have them. It’s in the ability to move through them with meaning, and in how we relate to them, that we separate ourselves from suffering. I live by this quote inspired by Buddhist philosophy:

> Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional.

What also happened is that I got busy creating some programmes for my business –\
something that was born alongside my desire to run the London Marathon, little over a year ago.

During today’s run, as I was running exactly through these fields in Barcelona, I had a moment of clarity:\
Six months ago, I was just beginning to train for the London Marathon – my first ever, and I had no idea how it would go.

As I embarked on this training, so much has happened:

> My mother-in-law came to visit us in England and had to be hospitalised – she ended up living with us for 6 months.
>
> My partner and I stepped into caregiving roles, while raising a young child.
>
> Building a new business in the back of unexpected redundancy.
>
> Facing relationship turbulence.

That’s one version of the story – the surface one.\
But underneath, what was really happening was this:\
A spiritual awakening. A deep identity shift. A rebirth.\
I had made a decision: to live on my own terms.\
And that meant letting go of old patterns, self-doubt, people-pleasing, and self-sacrifice.\
Everything felt chaotic, raw and uncertain.\
And yet – I stayed committed to one thing: becoming this new version of me.\
The one that knows what’s good for her: creating, connecting, moving.\
It became my anchor. My promise to myself.\
\
I remember one cold, rainy morning.\
My son had a fever and had to stay home from school. My relative was recovering from surgery.\
My old self would have stayed, sacrificed, and swallowed her own needs.\
But not this time.\
I paused and asked myself: *What do I need, too?*\
They were fine – one watching TV, the other on her phone -*“Text me if there’s an emergency”* (both totally capable)\
So I laced up my shoes and went for that 5K.\
That run marked a pivotal moment: *I’m committed to the woman I’m becoming.*

Training and running the marathon helped me build resilience.\
But more than that, it built momentum for a new life.

Reflecting back now, almost one month after the marathon, here’s what I’ve noticed:

> My energy is grounded – I feel recharged, not depleted
>
> My nervous system and immune system feel stronger than ever
>
> I crave movement - running is no longer a task, it’s part of who I am
>
> Even when life feels messy, I bounce back faster – that’s resilience

A very dear friend recently said to me *“I saw you’ve run a marathon… I think people who run are perhaps escaping from something”*.\
I paused and reflected, and for me, it’s been quite the opposite. Running has helped me come home to myself, to my body, my power, my truth.

I’m so excited about what’s been possible through my new decision, that I wanted to share what I’ve created in the last 2 weeks.\
\
I’ve started a **Weekly Reframe** on LinkedIn – a space to reflect on the emotional and mental shifts that help us move forward, even when life feels messy.

Every Friday at 1PM UK, I go live and share an insight based on a real, anonymous challenge someone has sent me – from life transitions, self-doubt or sumply feeling stuck.

Replay the [first episode here](https://lnkd.in/eFTfdqhY).\
Want to submit a challenge for the next Reframe? You can [share it anonymously here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn12WMqpxSwN4Yebm-DJ4xJyZjD-Hj6NzjBErMgHpaEd6Blg/viewform).\
And if you’d like to join me live – [connect with me on LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudiadecarlo/).

Thanks for reading. It means a lot.

Let’s keep running – forward, inward, and together. 🌱

If this resonated with you, I’d love to hear from you – feel free to like, leave a comment, or share it with someone who might need it. 🌱
