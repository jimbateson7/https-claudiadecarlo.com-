  Claudia listens, and I felt seen and understood in a way that was both
  grounding and clarifying.


  Claudia has a rare gift. She can read between the lines and gently bring awareness to emotions and patterns that were hidden fro me. Through our chats, I gained greater clarity around where I was blocked, deeper emotional understanding, and a stronger sense of direction in my life.


  Her presence, insight, and thoughtful guidance helped me navigate an important period with more confidence and self-trust. I am truly grateful for the depth, care, and integrity she brings to our work together.
