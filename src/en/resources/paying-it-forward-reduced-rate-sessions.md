I know what it feels like to deeply want change but face financial limitations. I’ve been fortunate to have tenacity and to receive generous support that helped me move forward.

As a way of giving back, I offer coaching or mentoring sessions at a reduced rate to support others on their journey. Availability is limited and subject to scheduling.

This programme is designed for those facing financial challenges but who are deeply committed to their personal growth and transformation.

If you’re interested in being considered, please get in touch to express your interest, and I will get back to you.
