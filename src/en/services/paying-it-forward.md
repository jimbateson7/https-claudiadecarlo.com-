summary: >-
  I know what it feels like to deeply want change but face financial
  limitations. I’ve been fortunate to have tenacity and to receive generous
  support that helped me move forward.


  As a way of giving back, I offer coaching or mentoring sessions at a reduced rate to support others on their journey. Availability is limited and subject to scheduling.


  This program is designed for those facing financial challenges but who are deeply committed to their personal growth and transformation.


  If you’re interested in being considered, please email me to express your interest, and I will get in touch.
