summary: >-
  A powerful 21-day start to help you regain your energy, reconnect with
  yourself, and build the momentum needed for real and lasting change.


  This program is for people who know something needs to shift, but don’t quite know where to start. If you’ve tried to do it on your own, if you feel disconnected, reactive, or stuck in cycles of self-pressure, this is your first step toward breaking free.


  You’ll begin to create sustainable habits with more clarity, purpose, and ease—without falling into extremes or impossible expectations.


  It’s a safe space to transform your relationship with yourself and start building change from the inside out.

## **What it does:**

I’ll guide you to break out of the superficial cycle of control, guilt, and self-pressure. Together, we’ll lay the foundations—supported by neuroscience—for long-term habit change, helping you reconnect with yourself from a place of presence, not pressure.

You’ll experience small early wins, so you don’t feel overwhelmed or stuck in all-or-nothing thinking. You’ll also become more aware of your emotional triggers and subconscious patterns, using practical tools from day one.

If you don’t feel “ready” for a full transformation yet, this is a safe and effective starting point.

## **Who it’s for:**

This program is for you if you know something needs to change, but you’re unsure where to begin.

It’s for anyone who wants to reconnect, find clarity, and build new habits from a place of self-compassion—not self-punishment.

## **Includes:**

Three private 1:1 coaching sessions and 21 days of Telegram group support—or, if you prefer a lighter approach, you can choose to receive guidance and inspiration via email.

## **Investment:**

Beta price: £376 (*Full launch price: £757)

If you decide to upgrade to the full 12-week program “Reclaim Your Body with Your Mind” within 10 days of completing this program, you’ll receive a special discount.

I offer a free call to help you decide if this program is right for you.
