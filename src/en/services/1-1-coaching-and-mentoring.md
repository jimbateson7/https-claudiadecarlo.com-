  ### **You know something needs to shift, but don’t quite know where to
  start.**


  If you’ve tried to do it on your own, if you feel disconnected, reactive, or stuck in cycles of self-pressure, this is your first step toward breaking free.


  You’ll begin to see things differently, feel and act accordingly, and as a result you'll start seeing the results you want. 


  You'll learn to create sustainable habits with more clarity, purpose, and ease, without falling into extremes or impossible expectations.


  I offer a safe space to transform your relationship with yourself and start building change from the inside out.\

## Who it’s for

Growth-driven individuals who know they’re meant for more;

Ready to transform through self-discovery so the can finally move through life with clarity, confidence, and joy.

## What it does

* Notice what’s already working in your life, and what isn’t.
* Shift unhelpful patterns into empowered choices.
* Make aligned decisions with more ease and flow.
* Expand your potential without the constant pressure.

## Details

My coaching rate is £110 per hour. I recommend starting with a 90-minute first session to create enough space for deeper work. After that, we’ll decide together (based on your needs and our dynamic) whether 60 or 90 minutes is the best fit. This is always agreed during the free discovery call to ensure I can offer what's best for you.

For those genuinely committed but unable to meet this rate, I offer a free call to discuss (see the Paying It Forward article in the Resources section). This option is available on a case-by-case basis, guided by willingness, openness, and alignment.

If you’re ready to reconnect with yourself and transform your life from the inside out, book your call and share your situation with me – or simply email me with what’s on your heart.\
