## Hey, Iâ€™m ClauÂ 

Just a regular girl who dared to believe she could transform her lifeÂ âœ¨

Through curiosity, courage, and a deep commitment to growth, Iâ€™ve moved through trauma, health challenges, and difficult diagnoses. I believed it was possible - and made it happen.

Now, I help others do the same.

My approach gets to the root of whatâ€™s holding you back, blending self-awareness and practical tools - so you can face life with new eyes, and move forward with aligned energy.

Iâ€™ve been obsessed with personal growth since I was a teenager, and now I guide others to experience the transformation that self-awareness makes possible.

With my support, clients experience:

ðŸ§  Freedom - from limiting beliefs and unconscious scripts

ðŸ’ª Empowerment - through conscious choices and emotional intelligence

ðŸŒ¿ Alignment - with who they truly are, and the life they want to create

Iâ€™m an ordinary girl who knows sheâ€™s extraordinary -Â and I believe you are too.\
You just need to believe it... and be brave enough to dream big.

Iâ€™m also aâ€¦
