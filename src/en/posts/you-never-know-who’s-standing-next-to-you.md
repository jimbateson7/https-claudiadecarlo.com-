A few weeks ago I was in Valencia to interview the singer and songwriter of a rock band experiencing a massive growth in popularity after decades of career. To talk about authenticity, purpose, and following one's passion. They’ve always embraced their “weirdness,” refusing to change to fit in. And that choice paid off.

I was also at their concert before the interview, but I didn’t expect to be part of something so beautiful that night. Next to me there was a teenage girl, tearful and shaking with excitement, completely immersed in the moment. It was fascinating to watch. 

At some point, she took out a small notepad and carefully wrote the names of all the members of the band, leaving a space underneath each one for their signature. Then she threw the notepad onto the stage.

One of the musicians caught it in the air, smiled, and put it on the floor to keep playing. When the concert ended, he didn’t pick it up again (I sort of knew it, but she had hope!). The band left the stage, and the crew almost stepped on it as they cleared the equipment.

A dream, left behind. She looked heartbroken, the dream so close.. yet just out of reach. But I knew I could change that ending. I waited for her to recover her notepad and said: "Give it to me, I’ll be back in 5 minutes." And I came back with all the autographs.

She couldn’t believe her eyes!

That was a special moment because I could see all along that she had an unwavering determination. She reminded me of a younger version of myself, full of conviction that what she was aiming for wasn’t too big. It mattered to her, so she went for it ... that version of us still lives in us.

Life didn’t give her the dream in the exact way she imagined, but it still happened. That’s the magic of 𝘵𝘳𝘶𝘴𝘵, of believing without knowing 𝘩𝘰𝘸.

Maybe she was just delusional, and I say: "Go you, be delusional!"

> No dream is too silly or crazy that life won’t help you make it happen.
>
> You never really know who is next to you, witnessing your excitement about that dream.

If we pay attention, we might notice who around us could use a little magic, who might need us to lend that invisible hand that takes them one step closer.

If I could leave you with this today.. 

What can you do that feels effortless to you, that for someone else might mean the world. 

Who could you be the bridge for today? Go do it.
