summary: >-
  I know what it's like to deeply desire change but being limited by financial
  constraints. I’ve been blessed with a stubborn determination and found my way
  to reach the support of others, sometimes available thanks through their
  generosity. 


  As a way to pay it forward, I'm offering reduced rate coaching or mentoring sessions to help someone else on their journey.


  This programme is for those who face financial challenges yet are deeply committed to personal growth and transformation.


  To be considered, please complete this application with details on your current challenges, aspirations, and commitment to growth.
