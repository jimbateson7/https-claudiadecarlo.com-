## What It Does:

* Helps you break the surface-level cycle of control and guilt.
* Lays the neuroscience-based foundation for habit change.
* Starts to reconnect you with your body, not from pressure, but from presence.
* Helps you experience early wins so you're not overwhelmed or stuck in all-or-nothing thinking.
* Brings awareness to emotional triggers and subconscious patterns with tools you can start applying right away.

You don’t need to be “ready” for the full transformation. You just need a safe place to start.

## Who It's For:

* You know the weight isn’t just physical.
* You’ve tried diets and willpower - it didn’t work.
* You feel disconnected, reactive, or out of sync with yourself.
* You want clarity and momentum before committing to the full 90 days.

## Includes:

* 3x private 1:1 sessions
* Telegram group support for 21 days (or optional email check-ins if you want to keep it lighter)

## Investment:

**Intro Offer:** £376
\
**Full Value Price (after intro):** £757

**Option to upgrade into the 90-Day Signature Programme with discount applied** if you join within 10 days of completion.

You’ve already invested £376. If you join the 90-day programme within 10 days, I’ll credit that in full, so your upgrade price is just £601 instead of £977.
