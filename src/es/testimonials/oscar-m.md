  Gracias por la increíble transformación que siento después de nuestra
  conversación. En tan solo dos horas, sentí un cambio profundo en mi
  mentalidad. Me siento más empoderada, en paz e incluso físicamente más ligera.
  Las cargas que antes llevaba parecen haberse aliviado, dejándome con una
  renovada sensación de libertad y claridad. ¡Estoy muy agradecida por esta
  experiencia!


  Valoro muchísimo nuestras sesiones y la sabiduría y el enfoque de Claudia. Tiene una increíble capacidad para escuchar y comprender. Después de nuestra última sesión, la vida me planteó los desafíos habituales (algunos problemas en mi relación) y me sorprendió lo diferente que reaccioné: ¡no reaccioné! ¡Qué cambio! Recomiendo ampliamente a Claudia a cualquiera que busque una transformación profunda e impactante y quiera ver resultados rápidamente.

## Oscar’s story: From heartbreak to setting himself free

{% video "/static/uploads/oscar-testimonial-reduced-.mp4" %}{% endvideo %}

Oscar came to me in tears. His relationship was ending, and even though he hadn’t felt truly happy in it for a while, the thought of letting go brought up even more pain. 

He felt low, confused, and humiliated after a series of difficult events with his partner. He was trying to hold together something that deep down, he already knew wasn’t right for him.

In our very first session, we uncovered where the real pain was coming from - not just the breakup, but an old wound that had been silently shaping his choices.

We shifted from a victim mindset to one of self-worth and clarity. He began to see that he was allowed to choose what (and who) he lets into his life.

He realised he was done settling. The relationship didn’t reflect the kind of love he truly wanted. He’d been staying out of habit, fear, and comfort. But something clicked: this wasn’t what he deserved.

He felt a huge sense of relief.

Together, we brought hidden patterns to the surface: those subconscious beliefs that had kept him stuck. Once they were seen, they began to loosen their grip.

Oscar began to *choose* himself.

He’s an enthusiastic, passionate man who had been settling for frustration and emotional struggle, trying to hold together a relationship that had long lost its essence.

This is what’s possible, even with just a few sessions of deep, intentional work. Oscar already had the answers inside him. He just needed someone to hold space for him, and  help him untangle the knot of thoughts and emotions keeping him stuck.

Thank you, Oscar, for allowing me to walk alongside you during this turning point. I’m so proud of the way you’re stepping into this new chapter, with clarity, self-respect, and heart.
