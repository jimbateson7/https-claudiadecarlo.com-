quote: >-
  As a professional woman whose career path has changed late in life it has been
  a very difficult period for me, and with Claudia’s guidance I have found a
  different way to move forward into a new career.


  We don’t always see where we are, and getting back onto our own path, to move into a positive direction is amazing, especially when we get ourselves into a situation where we cannot see ourselves as worthy or even good enough to do something new to expand our own ideas of  who we are.


  Claudia’s help has been tremendous. Thank you for new possibilities.
