  Working with Claudia is great. She listens, is honest, empathetic and helps
  you celebrate little wins building towards your goal.


  When I started working with Claudia, I was filled with anxiety, self-confidence and self-worth issues. I had fallen out of love with running and training, always telling myself I couldn’t do it again, or I’d start another time.


  I’m now back enjoying a running plan and when I find myself thinking negatively about myself, or not appreciating situations, a little Claudia pops up and reminds me to be kind to myself. I’ve lost a lot of physical and mental “weight” since starting to work with Claudia and shift the way I think about myself. It takes time and it can be hard after thinking a certain way for so long, but the work is paying off.
