  Working with Claudia is great. She listens, is honest, empathetic and helps
  you celebrate little wins building towards your goal.


  When I started working with Claudia, I was filled with anxiety, self-confidence and self-worth issues. I had fallen out of love with running and training, always telling myself I couldn’t do it again, or I’d start another time.


  I’m now back enjoying a running plan and when I find myself thinking negatively about myself, or not appreciating situations, a little Claudia pops up and reminds me to be kind to myself. I’ve lost a lot of physical and mental “weight” since starting to work with Claudia and shift the way I think about myself. It takes time and it can be hard after thinking a certain way for so long, but the work is paying off.

**Jim’s Success Story:**

Jim’s Story: Running back to confidence

Jim first saw me speak at a lightning talk last year. Something landed for him at that moment, he started following me on LinkedIn, and eventually reached out for support.

He was struggling with social anxiety. He hadn’t passed probation in his previous role, which had come shortly after a redundancy. His confidence was low, and he felt disconnected from himself, especially from the part of him that used to run ultra-marathons and speak in public with ease.

Over a couple of months working together, things began to shift.

He started to rebuild his self-belief. He got back into running. He began to feel stronger, more grounded, and more like himself again. 

And then, he signed a new job contract!

He stepped back into public speaking. He went from avoiding breakout rooms in online events - worried he might be kicked out or not know what to say - to giving presentations and applying for new speaking gigs.

Jim already had what it took. He just needed the right support to reconnect with his strength and move forward with clarity.

Jim, I’m proud of how you showed up for yourself. You did the work, and it shows. I’m excited to see what comes next for you.
