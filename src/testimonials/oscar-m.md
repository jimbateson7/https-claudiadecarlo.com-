  Thank you for the incredible transformation I can feel after our conversation.
  In just two hours, I felt a profound shift in my mindset. I’m more empowered,
  at peace, and even physically lighter. The burdens I once carried seem to have
  lifted, leaving me with a renewed sense of freedom and clarity. I am so
  grateful for this experience!


  I truly value our sessions and Claudia’s wisdom and approach. She has an incredible ability to listen and understand. After our last session, life threw the usual challenges my way (going through some relationship challenges) and I was amazed at how differently I responded - I didn’t react! What shift! I highly recommend Claudia for anyone seeking deep and impactful transformation and wanting to see results in a short time.

## Oscar’s Story: From heartbreak to setting himself free

Oscar came to me in tears. His relationship was ending, and even though he hadn’t felt truly happy in it for a while, the thought of letting go brought up even more pain.

He felt low, confused, and humiliated after a series of difficult events with his partner. He was trying to hold together something that deep down, he already knew wasn’t right for him.

In our very first session, we uncovered where the real pain was coming from - not just the breakup, but an old wound that had been silently shaping his choices.

We shifted from a victim mindset to one of self-worth and clarity. He began to see that he was allowed to choose what (and who) he lets into his life.

He realised he was done settling. The relationship didn’t reflect the kind of love he truly wanted. He’d been staying out of habit, fear, and comfort. But something clicked: this wasn’t what he deserved.

He felt a huge sense of relief.

Together, we brought hidden patterns to the surface: those subconscious beliefs that had kept him stuck. Once they were seen, they began to loosen their grip.

Oscar began to *choose* himself.

He’s an enthusiastic, passionate man who had been settling for frustration and emotional struggle, trying to hold together a relationship that had long lost its essence.

This is what’s possible, even with just a few sessions of deep, intentional work. Oscar already had the answers inside him. He just needed someone to hold space for him, and  help him untangle the knot of thoughts and emotions keeping him stuck.

Thank you, Oscar, for allowing me to walk alongside you during this turning point. I’m so proud of the way you’re stepping into this new chapter, with clarity, self-respect, and heart.
