I was exploring with Claudia my difficulties in finding like-minded friends and people who I could connect with. After listening intently, Claudia shone a light on the words I had been using in relation to this, she explained that my thoughts will always be reflected in the outside world. This really landed and got me thinking about what my deeper beliefs were around meeting like-minded people. As a result of this I was then able to change my thinking around this subject and like magic, new connections started to appear from everywhere! Thanks for your wisdom and insights Claudia
