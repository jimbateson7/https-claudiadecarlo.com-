  Claudia helped me achieve a goal that I no longer thought was possible. I was
  juggling working full-time, getting my doctoral degree and caring for my
  elderly parents. I've been procrastinating on this task, it was getting out of
  hand and bringing me down. I stopped entertaining, something that I loved but
  the thought of tackling it overwhelmed me, and as each day passed and I did
  nothing, my situation got worse along with my mood. Claudia helped me achieve
  a goal that I no longer thought was possible.


  I greatly appreciate Claudia, without her I wouldnâ€™t have been able to achieve my goal.
