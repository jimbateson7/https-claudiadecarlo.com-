## Ari’s Story: Remembering her worth

Ari had been working as a dental technician for 12 years when she was offered a new opportunity within the same company - an administrative role that promised a refreshing change after over a decade in the same position.

She welcomed the shift, but stepping into a new field brought uncertainty. She felt unprepared, unsupported, and alone. Her manager kept postponing 121 meetings, and her colleague -more experienced in the role- was unhelpful, possibly trying to make her "earn her place." There was no real guidance, no resources offered by the company, and she had to study and train herself in her own time.

Despite her best efforts, frustration started to build. She was giving so much of herself, but receiving very little in return. That’s when she reached out to me.

In our sessions, we began to explore what was really going on beneath the surface. Ari realised she was constantly seeking validation outside of herself - waiting for someone else to see her, value her, and acknowledge all that she was bringing. But the truth was: she wasn’t valuing *herself*.

Once that clicked, everything began to change.

She started taking aligned action: speaking up, setting boundaries, and standing tall in her own worth. And people around her responded. The energy shifted. But more importantly, *she* shifted.

Eventually, Ari made a powerful choice. She realised that this new role, without proper support or a healthy environment, wasn’t where she wanted to stay. She returned to her original position - this time with a raise and a more welcoming team.

What I admire most about Ari is her willingness to do the inner work. Her growth wasn’t about the role within the company - it was about remembering who she inherently is, and what she deserves.

Ari, I’m so proud of you. Keep walking with that quiet power, and never lose sight of your value.
